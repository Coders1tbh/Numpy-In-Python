# NumPy in Python

NumPy stands for Numerical Arrays in Python. It is an important library used to build and compute arrays. It is the fundamental package used for scientific computing and it's at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystem.

The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.

To start with our package, we need to install the package , if using Anaconda IDE then code condo install numpy or if you are using PyCharm then code pip install NumPy.

To import the NumPy package, we write import numpy as np. We shorten the name of the package NumPy as np for better usage in the body of the code. This is a widely adopted convention that you should follow so that anyone working with your code can easily understand it.
